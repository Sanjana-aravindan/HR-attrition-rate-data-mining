Attrition rate is also one of the key business metrics, as the cost of retaining an existing employee is far less than acquiring a new one. As employee retention becomes a valuable metric, it is in companies best interest to reduce employee attrition rate. Thus, in our project, we have tried to provide a distinction between prevailing employees and employees
who left the organization by examining the correlation among employee details from the dataset we use. By mining this data, we were able to interpret what kind of employees are currently employed in the organization and what kind of employees left the organization. Determining the cause of employee attrition helps an organization make positive changes and deliver better experiences to meet employees expectations and ultimately reduce at-
trition rate.
Approaches to determine attrition rate:
Data pre-processing and exploration
Principal component analysis
Clustering
Apriori algorithm for Association analysis
